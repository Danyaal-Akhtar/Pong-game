# Pong - My First PyGame Project

Welcome to my very first personal project made with **Python** and **PyGame**: a remake of the **Pong** game, simple but fun!

## Objective

Create a retro 2D Pong game to learn the basics of game programming with PyGame.

## Technologies used

- Python
- PyGame

## Commands

- Player 1: `Z` (up), `S` (down)
- Player 2: `↑` (up), `↓` (down)

## Launch the game

Make sure you have PyGame installed:

``bash
pip install pygame
